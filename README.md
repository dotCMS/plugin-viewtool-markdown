# Github Flavored Markdown plugin

## Description
This dotCMS osgi plugin provides a github flavored markdown (gfm) compatible markdown parser (for the most part).  It is built off of the txtmark project  https://github.com/rjeschke/txtmark by Ren√© Jeschke.  It provides a viewtool that can be used in dotCMS to parse text/content for gfm.

###Usage
`$markdown.parse("**Parse** *this* ~~string~~")` will result in

**Parse** *this* ~~string~~


`$markdown.parseFile("/application/my-file.md")`
or
$markdown.parseFile("/application/my-file.md", false)

Will parse /application/my-file.md


`$markdown.parseFile("/application/my-file.md", true)`

Will render the file `/application/my-file.md` as velocity then parse the output of it as markdown

You can also call a file on a different site (hosted in the same dotCMS instance)
`$markdown.parseFile("//global.host.com/application/my-file.md")`

will parse the /application/my-file.md on global.host.com

There are no dependices to install, all you need to do is upload the ./build/libs/plugin-viewtool-markdown-0.1.jar into your dynamic plugins screen and the viewtool should become active.
